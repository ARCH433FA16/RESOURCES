# Getting Started with the Particle Photon

## What is a Photon

The particle photon is an Internet of Things (IoT) device that consists of a microcontroller (ARM Cortex M3) and a Wifi Module (Broadcomm) on one postage-stamp-sized printed circuit board. The Photon is Arduino compatible, meaning that you can program the Photon with the same language as the Arduino. You can also program in C/C++. During normal usage, all programming is done in a web-browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The program you write in your browser is compiled and sent to the Photon via its WiFi connection to the Particle cloud. In order for all this to happen, the Photon must be first connected to the internet. When you open your Photon, it knows nothing about the local networks. You must give the Photon credentials for a Wifi network. Unfortunately, the Photon cannot join enterprise networks such as the school's wifi networks. You will either connect to a wifi network created by your instructor in class, or you can also connect to a hotspot you create on your phone.

So if you have a Photon that requires a Wifi network connection for programming, and it's not yet on a network because you need to give it Wifi credentials, how do you resolve the paradox? There's one other way to connect to the Photon, and that's via a USB cable (Male A to Micro Male B). You can connect your Photon to aither a Windows or OSX machine. Note that if you are using windows, you will have to download nad install a driver from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/spark-website/Particle.zip)
